Implemented a value iteration algorithm for a simple grid-based navigation problem with a single goal location and an arbitrary configuration of obstacles.
Problem Def: An agent navigates on a 5 × 5 grid using four actions, N, W, S, E. Each of the actions leads to the next square in the given direction with a probability of 0.7 and to each of the neighboring cells at a 90? angle with a probability of 0.15. If the action would lead across the grid boundary, the action will result in staying in the same grid cell
